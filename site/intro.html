                Your report provided sufficient evidence to warrant a search of Helena's personal correspondence. While no "smoking gun" was found directly, the messages revealed a likely motive.
            <br><br>
                On May 24, 2215, an individual identified as "Jon" contacted Helena regarding an open-source contribution. Over the following months, this escalated into a romantic relationship. Helena indicated she would soon be able to leave Station A382 to meet him. It appears she hoped this accident would nullify outstanding contracts with Archon LLC, triggering a severance payout.
            <br><br>
                Further investigation into "Jon" suggests the persona was likely an artificial intelligence. The correspondence appears to have been a social engineering attack designed to recruit Helena for a competitor.

    body: `<p>
                Forensic analysis of Rolf's computer revealed damning evidence. An application named <i>pref_gen</i> was found, with metadata tying its creation to Helena. This tool generated the preference data containing the malicious payload. Had Rolf not manually modified a configuration value, the exploit would have executed without crashing, likely removing any obvious trace of the memory corruption.
            <br><br>
                Congratulations on a successful investigation. Legal will handle the liability specifics regarding the software flaws and the settlement for Alex's death.

                First, she just happened to be an anonymous reviewer for the controller code.

                She was in a position to be a big enough pain about configuration control that she basically got everyone to chip into the murder to just work around her stonewalling.
