                Your report provided sufficient evidence to warrant a search of Helena's personal correspondence. While no "smoking gun" was found directly, the messages revealed a likely motive.
            </p>
            <p>
                On May 24, 2215, an individual identified as "Jon" contacted Helena regarding an open-source contribution. Over the following months, this escalated into a romantic relationship. Helena indicated she would soon be able to leave Station A382 to meet him. It appears she hoped this accident would nullify outstanding contracts with Archon LLC, triggering a severance payout.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further investigation into "Jon" suggests the persona was likely an artificial intelligence. The correspondence appears to have been a social engineering attack designed to recruit Helena for a competitor.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, forensic analysis of Rolf's computer revealed damning evidence. An application named <i>pref_gen</i> was found, with metadata tying its creation to Helena. This tool generated the preference data containing the malicious payload. Had Rolf not manually modified a configuration value, the exploit would have executed without crashing, likely removing any obvious trace of the memory corruption.
            </p>

                Congratulations on a successful investigation. Legal will handle the liability specifics regarding the software flaws and the settlement for Alex's death.
